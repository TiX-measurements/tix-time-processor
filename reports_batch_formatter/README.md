# Reports Batch Formatter
This module organizes the log files generated by the TiX client into multiple batches. This is to imitate the way the tix-time-processor takes the files and computes them by separating them into different directories. These batches can then be analyzed by the general_analysis_notebook.

## Setup
From the `tix-time-processor` directory, execute:
```sh
virtualenv --no-site-packages -p python3 tix-processor-venv
source tix-processor-venv/bin/activate
```
```sh
pip install -r requirements-notebook.txt
```
The virtualenv name could be any name. We chose ```tix-processor-venv```

## Running the formatter
In order to run the formatter, simply run from `tix-time-processor/reports_batch_formatter`:
```sh
python formatter.py \
    --source_directory=path/to/logs \
    --output_directory=path/to/output \
```
